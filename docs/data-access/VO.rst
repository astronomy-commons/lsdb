[Under construction] Finding HATS catalogs via VO
========================================================================================

To discover additional HATS-related services registered across the community, use the :
`Virtual Observatory Registry search <https://vao.stsci.edu/registry-search/?f%5BcapabilityType_facet%5D%5B%5D=Custom+Service&per_page=100&q=hats&search_field=all_fields/>`__ 

This can help you identify:

- other institutions serving HATS/LSDB-style catalogs
- endpoints and access metadata (when provided)
- service descriptions and maintainers
