LSDB
========================================================================================

LSDB (Large Survey DataBase) is a python framework that enables simple, fast spatial analysis of extremely
large astronomical catalogs (e.g. querying and crossmatching ~10‚Åπ sources). It aims to address large-scale
data processing challenges, in particular those brought up by `LSST <https://www.lsst.org/about>`_.

Built on top of Dask to efficiently scale and parallelize operations across multiple distributed workers, it
uses the `HATS <https://hats.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ data format to efficiently perform spatial
operations.
