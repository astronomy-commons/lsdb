    "In the previous tutorial we looked at loading a catalog and inspecting it's metadata. When we call `open_catalog()`, only the catalog's metadata is loaded, not any of the data in the rows of the catalog. This is because operations in LSDB are *lazy*: when you call the operation it isn't actually executed immediately."

    "As explained in the video above, instead of executing the operation when you call it, the operation is just planned. The catalog object keeps track of the pipeline of operations by building a task graph - an object that keeps track of the pipeline of operations you want to perform on the catalog. This way, you can write the code for the pipeline locally, and the task graph will be sent to the workers to execute the pipeline in parallel. We can also perform optimizations to the task graph to make sure the workflow is as efficient as possible. This is how LSDB can scale from working on your local machine, to running pipelines on clusters or in the cloud without having to make any code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually execute the operations, you call the `catalog.compute()` method, which will execute the pipeline and return the resulting data as a pandas `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find that most use cases start with **LAZY** loading and planning operations, followed by more expensive **COMPUTE** operations. The data is only loaded into memory when we trigger the workflow computations, usually with a `compute` call.\n",

It runs the pipeline on the catalog partitions one by one, and finds the first few rows of the results."
