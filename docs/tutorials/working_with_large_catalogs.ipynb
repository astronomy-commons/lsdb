    "# Working with large catalogs\n",
    "\n",
    "Large astronomical surveys contain a massive volume of data. Billion object, multi-terabyte sized catalogs are challenging to store and manipulate because they demand state-of-the-art hardware. Processing them is expensive, both in terms of runtime and memory consumption, and performing it in a single machine has become impractical. LSDB is a solution that enables scalable algorithm execution. It handles loading, querying, filtering and crossmatching astronomical data (of HiPSCat format) in a distributed environment. \n",

    "With Dask, the operations defined in a workflow (e.g. this notebook) are added to a task graph which optimizes their order of execution. The operations are not immediately computed, that's for us to decide. As soon as we trigger the computations, Dask distributes the workload across its multiple workers and tasks are run efficiently in parallel. Usually the later we kick off the computations the better.\n",

    "Catalogs represent tabular data and are internally subdivided into partitions based on their positions in the sky. When processing a catalog, each worker is expected to be able to load a single partition at a time into memory for processing. Therefore, when loading a catalog, it's crucial to __specify the subset of columns__ we need for our science pipeline. Failure to specify these columns results in loading the entire partition table, which not only increases the usage of worker memory but also impacts runtime performance significantly."
