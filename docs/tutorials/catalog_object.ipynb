    "The simplest way to load a catalog in LSDB is to call `lsdb.open_catalog()` with a path to a catalog in the HATS format. This will return a `Catalog` object with all the high level metadata loaded that LSDB needs to enable you to work with the catalog. We recommend you to visit our website, [data.lsdb.io](https://data.lsdb.io), where you are able to find large surveys in HATS format publicly available to use. If you're looking for how to get your own external data into LSDB, see the topic [Import Catalogs](import_catalogs.html) instead.\n",

But there's one thing that we can't see: we haven't loaded any of the data yet! That's why we have the `...` as placeholders for the data, and the warning at the bottom. This is because LSDB's operations are what we call *lazy*: they don't actually perform any work on the data when you call them, they just plan out the pipeline of operations to be performed later. This is how LSDB can work on huge catalogs with billions of rows, and run on any scale of device from a laptop up to a supercomputer. To learn more about how Lazy operations work, take a look at our [lazy operations tutorial.](lazy_operations.html)"

    "First, we will generate a basic plot showing the sky coverage of the catalog. The `Catalog` object's `plot_pixels` method shows a plot of the HATS partitioning of the catalog. GAIA is a survey that covers the whole sky, so we see the whole sky covered in pixels. The colors of the pixels represent the pixel sizes. The main advantage of HATS partitioning is that the partitions all contain roughly the same amount of rows, so the smaller the pixels, the more dense the catalog is in that area. This explains why we see smaller pixels in the galactic bulge."
