    "LSDB can handle datasets larger than memory by breaking them down into smaller, spatially-connected parts and working on each part one at a time. One of the main tasks enabled by LSDB are spatial queries such as cross-matching; to ensure accurate comparisons, all nearby data points need to be loaded simultaneously. LSDB uses HATS' method of organizing data spatially to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there's a limitation: at the boundaries of each divided section, some data points are going to be missed. This means that for operations requiring comparisons with neighboring points, such as cross-matching, the process might miss some matches for points near these boundaries because not all nearby points are included when analyzing one section at a time.\n",

    "To solve this, we could try to also load the neighboring partitions for each partition we crossmatch. However, this would require loading lots of unnecessary data, slowing down operations and causing issues with running out of memory. So, for each catalog, we also create a margin cache.
