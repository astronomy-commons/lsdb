    "LSDB can handle datasets larger than memory by breaking them down into smaller spatially-connected parts and working on each part one at a time. One of the main tasks enabled by LSDB are spatial queries such as cross-matching; To ensure accurate comparisons, all nearby data points need to be loaded simultaneously. LSDB uses HiPSCat's method of organizing data spatially to achieve this. However, there's a limitation: at the boundaries of each divided section, some data points are going to be missed. This means that for operations requiring comparisons with neighboring points, such as cross-matching, the process might miss some matches for points near these boundaries because not all nearby points are included when analyzing one section at a time.\n",

    "*Here we see an example of a boundary between HEALPix pixels, where the green points are in one partition and the red points in another. Working with one partition at a time, we would miss potential matches with points close to the boundary*\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we could try to also load the neighboring partitions for each partition we crossmatch. However, this would mean needing to load lots of unnecessary data, slowing down operations and causing issues with running out of memory. So for each catalog we also create a margin cache. This means that for each partition, we create a file that contains the points in the catalog within a certain distance to the pixel's boundary.\n",

To avoid this, we keep two separate task graphs, one for the catalog and one for its margin. For operations that don't require the margin, the task graphs are kept separate, and when `compute` is called on the catalog, only the catalog's task graph is computed without joining the margin or even loading the margin files. For operations like crossmatching that require the margin, the task graphs are combined with the margin joined and used. For these operations, we use only the margin for the catalog on the right side of the operation. This means that for each left catalog point that is considered, all of the possible nearby matches in the right catalog are also loaded, and so the results are kept accurate. But since there are no duplicates of the left catalog points, there are no duplicate results."
