    "You can save the catalogs that result from running your workflow to disk, in parquet format, using the `to_hipscat` call. \n",
    "\n",
    "You must provide a `base_catalog_path`, which is the output path for your catalog directory, and (optionally) a name for your catalog, `catalog_name`. The `catalog_name` is the catalog's internal name and therefore may differ from the catalog's base directory name. If the directory already exists and you want to overwrite its content set the `overwrite` flag to True. Do not forget to provide the necessary credentials, as `storage_options`, when trying to export the catalog to protected remote storage.\n",

    "The data is partitioned spatially and it is stored, in `parquet` format, according to the area of the respective partitions in the sky. Each parquet file represents a partition. The higher the `Norder` for a partition, the smaller it is in area. As a result, because partitions contain (approximately) the same number of points, those in a directory with a larger `Norder` hold data for denser regions of the sky. All this information is encoded in metadata files that exist at the root of our catalog."
